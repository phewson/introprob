\begin{question}
Consider a geographical area with a population of 2,500.   You are concerned that 250 of them may have Global Acute Malnutrition (GAM).  You have data from a sample of 30 individuals, none of whom has symptons of Global Acute Malnutrition (GAM).   If 10\% of the population (i.e. 250 people) had Global Acute Malnutition, what is the probability you get no people with GAM in your sample.


Another colleague suggests that you use the Binomial distribution where


\begin{displaymath}
<<<<<<< HEAD
P(X=x)  = {n \choose k} p^k (1-p)^{n-k}
=======
P(X=k)  = {n \choose x} p^k (1-p)^{n-k}
>>>>>>> 369e92ca97b2071ee9caf7ef0d1324aa7774c72a
\end{displaymath}

and you have $X$ as the number of people in your sample with GAM, $n$ is the size of your sample and $p$ is the probability that a person has GAM, i.e. $0.1$


On a written exam, you might be asked to give a careful statement as to the difference between the Hypergeometric and the Binomial, and the circumstances under which either is appropriate.

\end{question}

\begin{solution}

The key here is that you need:

\begin{displaymath}
<<<<<<< HEAD
P(X=k)  =  {n \choose k} p^k (1-p)^{n-k} = \Sexpr{round(dbinom(0,30,0.1),3)}
=======
P(X=k)  =  {n \choose x} p^k (1-p)^{n-k} = \Sexpr{round(dbinom(0,30,0.1),3)}
>>>>>>> 369e92ca97b2071ee9caf7ef0d1324aa7774c72a
\end{displaymath}


The main difference is that the Hypergeometric distribution assumes sampling with replacement.   The motivating model is an urn with beads of different colours.   When you remove one bead you have $N-1$ beads in total and you have either to add 1 or 0 to $k$ depending on the colour.   The binomial distribution assumes you are sampling without replacement.   In theory, you could sample the same individual again.   The larger the sample size, the less important this assumption becomes in practice.   Both are extensions of the Bernoulli distribution under the regime of either (a) sampling with replacement (Binomial) or (b) sampling without replacement (Hypergeometric).


As it happens, the bigger issue here (global acute malnutrition) requires that we find a decision rule with acceptable behaviour.   If 10\% of the population (or more!) had GAM, what value do we choose for $k$ for us to declare the region in need of assistance.
